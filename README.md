TheRNDmodel
===========

The R.N.D Model is a UML2.x based diagram project, (The Responsive Neoteric Device Model)

-------
The Responsive Neoteric Device Model - The project of building the model it-self in the form UML based diagrams: 
This is the repository setup for the UML diagrams alone, The conceptual ideas and design specifications will published here as UMLet format .uxf files. The software projects(AKA... Modules) will be hosted via there own repositories. Project "rndmod1" is the first module of what I hope will a suite of HTML5 content production and editing tools. All UML2.x based content will be developed here at this repo first. My plan is that there will be a UML diagrams folder in each projectc(or module) repository. These of course will only be the Diagrams that apply directly to module/project packages they uploaded  with. (Note ! as of 4/28/2014. I am still very new to UML so when I refer to posted diagrams as "UML.2x based" I mean it. I am still learning my UML(my UML still looks a little bit like pseudo UML, but I am working on it). I am currently working diagrams created using UMLet (stand alone)version 12.2
