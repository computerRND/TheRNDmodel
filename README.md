TheRNDmodel
===========

The R.N.D Model is a UML2.x based diagram project, (The Responsive Neoteric Device Model)

-------
The Responsive Neoteric Device Model - The project of building the model it-self in the form UML based diagrams: 
This is the repository setup for the UML diagrams alone, The conceptual ideas and design specifications will be maintained here as UMLet format .uxf files. The software projects(AKA... Modules) will be hosted via there own repositories. Project "module#1" will be the first module of what will later be a complete tool-kit of HTML5 content migration, production and editing tools all designed and coded using TheRNDmodel. All UML2.x based diagrams will be hosted and developed here. My plan is that there will be a UML diagrams folder in each project (or module) repository. The UML in the projects/mudules repositories will be a smaller set diagrams that apply only to project/repositories that are hosting them. 

Note ! as of 4/28/2014. I am still very new to UML so when I refer to my diagrams as "UML.2x based" I mean it. I am still learning my UML (Unlike other diagrams I have studied, my UML still looks a "little bit" like pseudo UML, but I am working on it). I am currently devloping my diagrams with UMLet version-12.x
