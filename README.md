TheRNDmodel
===========

The R.N.D Model is a UML2.x based diagram project, diagrams created using UMLet version 12.2

-------
This is the repository settup for the UML diagrams alone alone, The conceptual ideas and design specifications will published here (as UMLet format .uxf file) under this "TheRNDmodel" repository. The software projects(AKA... Modules) will be hosted via there own repositories. Project "rndmod1" is the first module of what I hope will a suite of HTML5 format content production tools. All UML2.x based content will developed here at this repo first. Though ! the plan is there will be a UML diagrams folder in each project repository. These of course will only be the Diagrams that apply directly to software packages they uploade  with. (Note ! as of 4/28/2014. I am still very new to UML so when I refer to posted diagrams as "UML.2x based" I mean it. I am still learning my UML.
